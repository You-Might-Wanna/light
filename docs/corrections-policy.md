# Corrections Policy

## Commitment to Accuracy

The Accountability Ledger is committed to factual accuracy. When errors are identified, we correct them promptly and transparently.

## Types of Changes

### Minor Corrections

Non-substantive changes that don't affect the meaning or accuracy of claims:

- Typographical errors
- Formatting improvements
- Link updates
- Minor clarifications

Minor corrections are made directly without status change.

### Material Corrections

Substantive changes to claims, evidence, or context:

- Factual errors in claims
- Missing important context
- Incorrect entity attribution
- Source misrepresentation

Material corrections:

- Change card status to "Corrected"
- Include correction note explaining what changed
- Preserve original version in history
- Update publish date

### Retractions

Full withdrawal of evidence cards when:

- Primary sources are determined to be inauthentic
- Claims cannot be supported by cited evidence
- Significant factual errors undermine validity
- New evidence fundamentally contradicts original claims

Retractions:

- Include retraction reason
- Keep card visible (struck through) for transparency
