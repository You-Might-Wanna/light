# Editorial Policy

## Purpose

The Accountability Ledger documents verifiable evidence of corporate and government misconduct using public sources. Our goal is to create a transparent, searchable record that serves the public interest.

## Evidence Standards

### Primary Sources

We prioritize primary source documents from authoritative sources:

- **Government agencies**: DOJ, SEC, EPA, FTC, OSHA, state attorneys general
- **Court filings**: Complaints, settlements, judgments, consent decrees
- **Regulatory actions**: Enforcement orders, fines, sanctions
- **Official reports**: Inspector general reports, audits, investigations

### Secondary Sources

When primary sources are unavailable, secondary sources may be used with clear labeling:

- News reporting from established outlets
- Academic research and investigative journalism
- Whistleblower disclosures (corroborated)

All secondary sources must be clearly identified and link to original reporting.

### Claim Requirements

Every evidence card must include:

1. **Falsifiable claim**: A specific, verifiable statement that can be confirmed or refuted
2. **Source citation**: Direct reference to primary documentation
3. **Event date**: When the documented conduct occurred
4. **Entity identification**: Clear identification of responsible parties

## What We DO NOT Publish

- Unverified allegations or rumors
- Personal opinions or commentary without factual basis
- Non-public personal information
- Content that could encourage harassment
- Speculation about motives or intent beyond documented facts

## Entity Guidelines

### Corporations & Organizations

We track actions by legal entities as documented in public records:

- Corporate misconduct (fraud, environmental violations, labor violations)
- Government agency actions and failures
- Nonprofit and vendor accountability

### Individuals

Individual names appear ONLY when:

- The individual is a public official acting in their official capacity
- The individual is named in official legal proceedings
- The conduct is directly relevant to their public role

We do NOT publish:

- Home addresses or personal phone numbers
- Family member information
- Non-work-related personal details
- Information about private individuals

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process

1. **Draft**: Author creates evidence card with sources
2. **Review**: Second reviewer verifies sources and claims
3. **Publish**: Card becomes publicly visible
4. **Monitor**: Ongoing monitoring for corrections

### Source Verification

All source documents are:

- Downloaded and stored with content hashing (SHA-256)
- Cryptographically signed for integrity verification
- Preserved even if original sources become unavailable

## Editorial Independence

The Accountability Ledger operates independently. We do not:

- Accept payment for coverage or omission
- Coordinate coverage with subjects of evidence cards
- Allow external parties to influence editorial decisions

## Updates and Amendments

As new information emerges, evidence cards may be:

- **Updated**: Minor corrections or additional context
- **Corrected**: Material changes with explanation
- **Retracted**: When fundamental errors are discovered

All changes are logged in version history.
